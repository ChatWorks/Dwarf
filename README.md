# Dwarf Redmine Theme
Public Version 1.0.0

### Inception
Hey folks!

Say "hello" to my new Hi-Res Redmine theme. I developed this theme to fit large screens - over 1600 pixels. I've used this theme for about two years and it's still in development, all fixes and improvements welcomed. Btw, pardon me for some CSS content inside SCSS files.

Feel free to make forks and suggest new improvements and versions.

### How it works?
1. This theme contain two couple screen conditions - HD, it's between 1600 and 1920, standard and portable.
2. Theme transform navigation to sidebar.

### Installation
1. Copy  ```production/dwarf directory``` into ```/public/themes``` directory on your Redmine instance.
2. Restart Redmine instance.
3. Activate theme inside settings.

### Settings
At this moment there's no additional settings for theme, so everything you can manage - located inside stylesheets and javascript.
