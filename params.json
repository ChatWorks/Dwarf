{"name":"Dwarf","tagline":"Dwarf is HD Redmine theme with many outstanding features.","body":"### Inception\r\nHey folks!\r\n\r\nLet's say \"hello\" to my Redmine theme. I developed this theme to fit large screens - screens over 1600 pixels width. I've used this theme for about two years and it's still in development - it's hard to make it pixel-perfect, so all fixes, PR and improvements welcomed. Overall scripts SCSS and JS not really clear.\r\n\r\n### How it works?\r\n1. Dwarf theme built responsive and support HD screens between 1600 and 1920.\r\n2. In HD mode theme navigation transforms to a sidebar.\r\n\r\n![Dwarf Projects Index](https://www.redmine.org/attachments/download/15177/dwarf-imac-small.png)\r\n\r\n### Issues List\r\nBelow you can see how's list of issues will looks with Dwarf.
